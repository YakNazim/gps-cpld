The xsvf file is what is 'played' through the JTAG to the CPLD.

This file is placed in Release in the top directory of the repo.

The proj directory is hard to check in becaues it encodes user's home directory in the ISE Webpack configuration files.


Warning: Openocd 0.9 has problems with the config file as of Tue 23 June 2015 20:06:55 (PDT)....use an earlier rev.
